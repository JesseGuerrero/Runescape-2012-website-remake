Below Lumbridge, however, resides a goblin race who are very much in charge of their wits, and are more considered in their actions than the most steadfast of humans.</p>

Lumbridge is by-and-large the friendliest, most accommodating city in all of Gielinor. It’s a quiet town, located on the west bank of the River Lum, and will be the first port of call to many players starting their adventure in RuneScape.

If towns were defined by the characters living within them, Port Sarim would be serving a life in jail, living by its wits, or would have died long ago from a cutlass deep in its chest.

Draynor Village is the quintessentially charming village town, with small lamps illuminating the sides of the road, wonderful gardens and a marketplace. But something isn’t right. You may not be able to put a finger on what it is. The people are odd; eccentric at best. They seem to be permanently on the edge, jittery and worried about what may happen to them… </p>

Edgeville is an incredibly popular resort town for the battle-hardened. Most of its popularity lies in its location near The Wilderness, as it acts as a hub for adventurers preparing to find riches in the vast player-killing environment to the north.

Mourners who visit the graveyard at Lumbridge do so to pay their respects to loved ones and leave gifts for the departed. Little do they know that, underneath the graveyard, are twisting catacombs filled with crypts that teem with undead and mutilated beings that have no business wandering the gods’ green surface.

Goblins are often portrayed as half-witted and with an uncanny ability to act before they think. Below Lumbridge, however, resides a goblin race who are very much in charge of their wits, and are more considered in their actions than the most steadfast of humans.

Crandor and Karamja seem as different as chalk and cheese. They have wildly different landscapes and climates, and attract different types of visitors to their shores. But their differences are only skin deep – beneath the islands is a connecting tunnel which houses incredibly foul, powerful beasts of all shapes and sizes.

Although Edgeville is a popular resort for travellers, and an area to stock up before venturing into the Wilderness, the dungeon beneath it is renowned as one of the most fearsome in the whole of Gielinor. The monsters are capable of slaying even the hardiest adventurer, and they won’t think twice about attacking you if you’re unprepared.

Varrock is one of the most important cities in the whole of Gielinor, with bustling traffic passing through on a daily basis. But, for all the hustle and bustle of the affluent surface, below is a sewer dungeon teeming with danger and infected with only the most vile creatures.

Thank the gods of Gielinor for dwarves! If it wasn’t for their mining skills, so many precious ores and rocks would still be locked away in the ground, away from the reach of humans and other races.

Many who have returned from the Wilderness say it’s the worst, most brutal place they’ve ever visited in Gielinor. Those who have returned from Daemonheim, however, marvel how they still have their minds intact. Many struggle to believe the stories of Daemonheim; there’s no way such a place can be steeped in so much evil, can there?

Long ago, the Wizards’ Tower was regarded as the ultimate destination for those who wished to discover magic and its secrets. Its spire reached into the heavens as a sign of its importance and prominence. Then invaders burned it down, and so many of its secrets were lost in embers.
